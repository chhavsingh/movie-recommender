# The Movie Recommender

This application provides five recommended movies names along with their posters by using all the details of the requested movie such as overview, genre, id, keywords, top cast, etc.

The details of the movies(title, genre, runtime, rating, poster, etc) are fetched using an API by TMDB, https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-movie-details.

# How to get the API key?
Create an account in https://www.themoviedb.org/, click on the API link from the left hand sidebar in your account settings and fill all the details to apply for API key. If you are asked for the website URL, just give "NA" if you don't have one. You will see the API key in your API sidebar once your request is approved.
